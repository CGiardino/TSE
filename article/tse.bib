@article{Krajewski1987,
	Abstract = {Guided by a panel of production and inventory managers from diverse plant environments, a comprehensive list of factors thought most important to manufacturing effectiveness was constructed. The panel established low and high values for each one. These settings were considered representative of the range experienced in U. S. plant environments. The factor settings allowed a variety of representative plants to be tested with a large scale simulator. Results show that kanban, when implemented in certain environmental settings, does indeed perform exceptionally well. However, so do the more traditional systems used in the United States. Conversely, there are other plant environments in which all systems perform much worse. This suggests that the factors themselves are the keys to major improvement.},

How should the usual scientific canons be reinterpreted for qualitative research? How should researchers report the procedures and canons used in their research? What evaluative criteria should be used in judging the research products? We propose that the criteria should be adapted to fit the procedures of the method. We demonstrate how this can be done for grounded theory and suggest criteria for evaluating studies following this approach. We argue that other qualitative researchers might be similarly specific about their procedures and evaluative criteria.},

No longer will students have to search the library or internet to find authoritative voices on a variety of topics. It's all right there at their fingertips - Juliet Corbin, San Jos\'{e} State University Grounded Theory is by far the most widely used research method across a wide range of disciplines and subject areas, including social sciences, nursing and healthcare, medical sociology, information systems, psychology, and anthropology. This handbook gives a comprehensive overview of the theory and practice of Grounded Theory, taking into account the many attempts to revise and refine Glaser and Strauss' original formulation and the debates that have followed. Antony Bryant \& Kathy Charmaz bring together leading researchers and practitioners of the method from the US, the UK, Australia and Europe to represent all the major standpoints within Grounded Theory, demonstrating the richness of the approach. The contributions cover a wide range of perspectives on the method, covering its features and ramifications, its intricacies in use, its demands on the skills and capabilities of the researcher and its position in the domain of research methods. The SAGE Handbook of Grounded Theory is an indispensable reference source for academics and researchers across many disciplines who want to develop their understanding of the Grounded Theory method.},

@book{McGrath2000,
	Abstract = {A Blueprint for Building Entrepreneurial OrganizationsNobody needs to tell you that in the new economy, managers using conventional strategies are losing out to smart, fast, entrepreneurial competitors who move on ideas others overlook and who confidently act while others dither. Are the managers of leading companies simply doomed to let this happen? Not at all, argue Rita Gunther McGrath and Ian MacMillan. The fundamental problem is that the tools, training, and conceptual frameworks that work for business-as-usual can't, and don't, work when your main challenge is to bury old business models and aggressively create completely new ones. To succeed, today's strategists need the thought process and discipline that are second nature to successful entrepreneurs. The Entrepreneurial Mindset offers a refreshingly practical blueprint for thinking and acting in environments that are fast-paced, rapidly changing, and highly uncertain. It provides both a guide to energizing the organization to find tomorrow's opportunities and a set of entrepreneurial principles you can use personally to transform the arenas in which you compete.Using lessons drawn from leading entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial companies, The Entrepreneurial Mindset presents a set of practices for capitalizing on uncertainty and rapid change. Like McGrath and MacMillan's bestselling Harvard Business Review articles, such as "Discovery-Driven Planning," the book provides simple but powerful ways to stop acting by the old rules and start thinking with the discipline of habitual entrepreneurs.The Entrepreneurial Mindset will show you how to: Eliminate paralyzing uncertainty by creating an entrepreneurial frame that shapes a shared understanding of what is to be accomplished and what would be worthwhile Create a richly stocked opportunity register in which you mobilize great ideas for redesigning existing products, finding new sources of differentiation, resegmenting existing markets, reconfiguring market spaces, and seizing the huge upside potential of breakthroughs Build a dynamic portfolio of businesses and options that continuously move your organization toward the future Execute dynamically your ideas so that you can move fast, with confidence and without undue risk Develop your own way of leading with an entrepreneurial mindset to create a vibrant entrepreneurial climate within your organizationThe Entrepreneurial Mindset is about succeeding in an unpredictable world. It will help everyone from independent entrepreneurs to managers of large corporations develop insights that others overlook and act on them to build the truly entrepreneurial organizations of the future.},

@book{Moore2002,
	Abstract = {Author Geoffrey Moore makes the case that high-tech products require marketing strategies that differ from those in other industries. His chasm theory describes how high-tech products initially sell well, mainly to a technically literate customer base, but then hit a lull as marketing professionals try to cross the chasm to mainstream buyers. This pattern, says Moore, is unique to the high-tech industry. Moore suggests remedies for the problem that can help businesses meet their long-term goals. He coaches marketing professionals on how to move slowly through the gulf, teaching them to create profiles and target specific segments of the population rather than trying to plow right into the mainstream. He cites examples of successful chasm crossings by such companies as Apple, Tandem, Oracle, and Sun, showing what they all had in common and exposing the different weaknesses in their strategies. Moore also assigns responsibility for success to programmers and developers by suggesting they design a "whole product model." Here, because integration tasks are daunting to the mainstream market, all the components of a technological product must be in one package. Moore also describes strategies for competing with rival companies and assessing the best distribution channels for penetrating the target market. Written not just for marketing specialists but for all employees whose futures ride on the success of a technical product, Crossing the Chasm delivers crucial information in an engaging, readable tone. Here is the bestselling guide that created a new game plan for marketing in high-tech industries. Crossing the Chasm has become the bible for bringing cutting-edge products to progressively larger markets. This edition provides new insights into the realities of high-tech marketing, with special emphasis on the Internet. It's essential reading for anyone with a stake in the world's most exciting marketplace.},

	Abstract = {A bacterial strain, designated AST4(T), was isolated from activated sludge. The bacterium did not show significant growth on nutrient broth, but growth was clearly stimulated by addition of supernatant from other bacterial cultures. Culture filtrate of a strain related to the genus Sphingomonas in particular increased the cell yield and growth rate of strain AST4(T). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AST4(T) is located within the 'Rhodobacter group' in the alpha-3 subclass of Proteobacteria, but is clearly distant from related genera in this group such as Paracoccus, Rhodobacter and Rhodovulum. Strain AST4(T) is a Gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped (0.6-0.8x1.3-2.0 micro m) and aerobic bacterium. It was not able to reduce nitrate to nitrite or N(2). No phototrophic growth was observed. Optimal growth occurred at 30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.5. The dominant cellular fatty acid in the isolate was C(18 : 1)cis11. Ubiquinone-10 was the major respiratory quinone. The G+C content was 64.5 mol\% (by HPLC). Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic traits, the name Catellibacterium nectariphilum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for this isolate; the type strain is AST4(T) (=NBRC 100046(T)=JCM 11959(T)=DSM 15620(T)).},

Founders at Work: Stories of Startups Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company. Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done.But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businessesdocreate valuemore intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.},

By doing what good companies were supposed to do-focus on pleasing their most profitable customers-leaders were paving the way for their own demise. How? By ignoring "disruptive technologies"-new, cheaper innovations that initially target small customer segments but evolve to displace the reigning product.},

@article{Ramesh2011,
	Abstract = {Distributed software development has become a common reality with the advent of off-shore development and the need to be close to markets. Also, the dynamic nature of the environment in which businesses operate suggests the use of agile development methods. Whereas distributed software development requires the use of formal processes advocated by plan-driven approaches, rapidly changing environments are appropriate candidates for the use of agile development methods. This tension in agile distributed development poses conflicting demands between alignment and adaptability in the software development process. We conducted a multisite case study of three projects that use agile distributed development to examine how these organizations developed contextual ambidexterity---the ability to pursue conflicting demands simultaneously. Our findings, presented as a conceptual framework, indicate that conflicting demands between alignment and adaptability posed by agile distributed development can be addressed by a set of balanced practices that shape performance management and social context---two important antecedents of contextual ambidexterity.},

	Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the issue of evaluating the innovative/entrepreneurial capabilities of small firms in high-technology industries. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is a literature review and case study. Findings - The contribution of the paper is twofold: in the first part, it is tried to distinguish the different forms of entrepreneurship existing. This leads to determine a form of entrepreneurship, plural entrepreneurship, that is typical in high-tech start-ups. In the second part, it is then tried to evaluate the innovative/entrepreneurial capabilities of a firm in such a framework. This is based on a longitudinal case study of a high-tech start-up where we explore how different dimensions of entrepreneurship coexist and interplay to create a firm's innovative dynamics depending on its initial resources and those added during the firm's growth. Originality/value - The paper is an original attempt to distinguish different notions of entrepreneurship including the notion of plural-entrepreneurship and capabilities in a small enterprise.},

	Abstract = {{This paper presents a challenge to the idea of what some scholars have
   called the entrepreneurial university. By applying and elaborating on
   Thomas Gieryn's concept of boundary work, it offers evidence to the
   effect that developing an entrepreneurial university is not as
   straightforward as it may seem from a more generalized perspective.
   Developing such an entity, at least in the confines of traditional,
   public-funded universities, is complicated by the emergence of a
   boundary between public and private activities. This study focuses on a
   potential hybrid research group: an academic group that sought to fuse
   its research with potential business activity within an ordinary
   university department. Controversies over four distinct issues arose: 1)
   the bureaucratic authority of a department chairman, 2) the allocation
   of teaching loads, 3) the ownership of research tools and materials and
   4) the intellectual property rights of the researchers. Ultimately, the
   controversy was resolved through a formal written contract that
   established two boundaries;: a border between the social roles of
   university researchers and those of private entrepreneurs, and a
   physical separation of the work done by academic projects from that of
   corporate development. As a result, the hybrid research group/firm was
   `purified' into a private entity with no direct ties to the university.}},

	Abstract = {At first glance, agile methods and global software development might seem incompatible. Agile methods stress continuous face-to-face communication, whereas communication has been reported as the biggest problem of global software development. One challenge to solve is how to apply agile practices in settings where continuous face-to-face interaction is missing. However, agile methods have been successfully used in distributed projects, indicating that they could benefit global software development. This paper discusses potential benefits and challenges of adopting agile methods in global software development. The literature on real industrial case studies reporting on experiences of using agile methods in distributed projects is still scarce. Therefore we suggest further research on the topic. We present our plans for research in companies using agile methods in their distributed projects. We also intend to test the use of agile principles in globally distributed student projects developing software for industrial clients},

   However, these initiatives do not highlight and consider the

   methods of applying social responsibility in firms are focused on medium
   and large firms, whose characteristics are so different, compared to

This volume comprises the first in-depth discussion of the masculinity dimension and how it can help us to understand differences among cultures. The book begins with a general explanation of the masculinity dimension, and discusses how it illuminates broad features of different cultures. The following parts apply the dimension more specifically to gender (and gender identity), sexuality (and sexual behaviour) and religion, probably the most influential variable of all.

@article{Faucheux1995,
	Abstract = {The paper's main concern is with different decision-making models for environmental issues and with the hypotheses of rationality underlying such models. The hypothesis supported here is that most environmental problems are in a context of uncertainty, of irreversibility and of complexity. We shall explain why stressing the role of these elements implies a reversal of the traditional attitude towards decision-making. This presupposes a paradigm of economic rationality much broader that that of orthodox economics, called ``procedural rationality''. Our paper is in two parts. The first part concerns the limits of the stochastic environmental approaches based on the Bayesian decision theory and on a substantive rationality hypothesis. The second part concerns the decision-making analyses based upon a procedural rationality, as well as their ability to take account of the interactions between uncertainty, irreversibility and complexity.},

	Abstract = {{Nowadays there is a visible shift from product-oriented economy towards
   service-oriented economy. This shift relates to a huge pressure on
   innovation in services and new offerings to the market. Concurrently
   with this shift, capabilities of IT/software tools are increasing
   rapidly. Such movements are opening new space in the dynamic market and
   are encouraging new ventures to be founded.
   A challenge for managers and leaders is to design processes and
   set/manage an internal environment that inherently supports creativity
   and cooperation between team members in new ventures.
   In this paper, we characterize a management model named
   INnovation\&COoperation (INCO) suitable for innovative software
   start-ups. We propose that the management processes and leadership of
   such enterprises have to have six distinctive qualities to support
   innovation and cooperation of team members. Proposed qualities are as
   follows: (1) network-hierarchical organizational structure; (2)
   assessment function of added value; (3) context awareness; (4) equal
   opportunities; (5) portfolio project management and uniformity; (6)
   embedded feedback. We believe that these qualities are essential for
   setting up a dynamic and flexible enterprise in the long-term
   perspective.
   A case study of a spin-off from Masaryk University, Czech Republic, is
   used to illustrate and validate this proposal in practice. This
   IT/software SME follows a network-hierarchical organizational structure,
   project team members are assigned dynamic roles and continuous feedback
   is provided to control and enhance collaboration and creativity.}},

	Abstract = {A sensitive and fast high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantitation of levodopa and carbidopa in human plasma was developed and validated. A simple protein precipitation step with perchloric acid was used for the cleanup of plasma, and methyldopa was added as an internal standard. The analyses were carried out using an ACE C(18) column (50 × 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 µm particle size) and a mobile phase consisting of 0.2\% formic acid and acetonitrile (90:10). The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source in positive mode was set up in the selective reaction monitoring mode to detect the ion transitions m/z 198.1 → m/z 107.0, m/z 227.2 → m/z 181.0, and m/z 212.1 → m/z 139.2 for levodopa, carbidopa, and methyldopa, respectively. The method was validated and proved to be linear, accurate, and precise over the range 50-5000 ng/mL for levodopa and 3-600 ng/mL for carbidopa. The proposed method was successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study with a levodopa/carbidopa tablet formulation in healthy volunteers. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The state-space formalism [Elliott S. J., et al. (2007). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 122, 2759-2771] allows one to discretize cochlear models in a straightforward matrix form and to modify the main physical properties of the cochlear model by changing the position and functional form of a few matrix elements. Feed-forward and feed-backward properties can be obtained by simply introducing off-diagonal terms in the matrixes expressing the coupling between the dynamical variables and the additional active pressure on the basilar membrane. Some theoretical issues related to different cochlear modeling choices, their implementation in a state-space scheme, and their physical consequences on the cochlear phenomenology, as predicted by numerical simulations, are discussed. Different schematizations of the active term describing the behavior of the outer hair cell's feedback mechanism, including nonlinear and nonlocal dependences on either pressure or basilar membrane displacement, are also discussed, showing their effect on some measurable cochlear properties.},

@article{Shrivastava2010,
	Abstract = {Distribution of software development is becoming more and more common in order to save the production cost and reduce the time to market. Large geographical distance, different time zones and cultural differences in distributed software development (DSD) leads to weak communication which adversely affects the project. Using agile practices for distributed development is also gaining momentum in various organizations to increase the quality and performance of the project. This paper explores the intersection of these two significant trends for software development i.e. DSD and agile. We discuss the challenges faced by geographically distributed agile teams and proven practices to address these issues, which will help in building a successful distributed team.},

	Abstract = {Start-up organisations are small companies that experience a high level of growth and considerable risk to their very survival until they evolve into stable, established companies. This situation presents a particular set of challenges in terms of corporate governance, yet research on the governance of start-ups is limited. This research paper examines and comments on the governance of start-up organisations in New Zealand. The study replicates and extends previous New Zealand-based research of boards of established companies. From the data gathered from the two surveys, conclusions can be drawn as to the role and focus of boards in start-ups versus established companies. The results are consistent with a model of active ownership which identifies key differences from established companies that could improve the governance of start-ups. The results also highlight the dependence of what might constitute effective corporate governance for a start-up on the strategic context of the company and its life cycle stage.},

Ultimately, these outcomes are formulated as direct antecedents of virtual team performance.

@article{Voas2001,
	Abstract = {The phrase: ``faster, better, and cheaper'' is quickly creeping into the vocabulary of software engineers, software publishers, and (as a result of the recent e-business craze) all of the IT industry. After all, if you wanted to be the first company to get on the Internet selling automobile tires in the 1990s, you had serious time constraints for getting there. Therefore the author discusses his beliefs on whether this phrase has any real utility for the software industry, or whether this is simply wishful thinking given our current technologies. To begin, let's define what these three terms mean. Faster simply refers to the speed at which a process can produce a product. If it produces the product more quickly, it satisfies the goal of faster. Better, of course, refers to the product's quality. If the quality improves, for example, higher reliability, then you've satisfied this target. And cheaper simply refers to the cost to produce the product. If that is lower, you've satisfied cheaper. The goal, then, of most mass-production manufacturing is to quickly produce quality products at a reduced cost per product unit. But the question becomes whether we can have faster, better, and cheaper software development or should only expect to have one or two of the three},

The type of companies in the focus of this paper are busy with developing breakthrough products and technology. Introducing a comprehensive quality system to the company raises two main problems: how to approach the issue of introducing an ISO 9001-based system to a company with little knowledge of quality, and how to adapt such a system to the needs of a company dealing with specific, new products. The paper describes in some detail problems of start-up companies growing into manufacturers. Some solutions, suggestions, and tips are provided for the gradual, streamlined, and systematic introduction of a full-scale quality system to the new company, with special attention to the tailoring process.},

Often a startup's software team follows a leaner path to achieve their goal: get a product out on time with no major defects. These teams frequently use public-domain tools and a mix of hybrid software development life cycle techniques, but there are as many nuanced processes as there are embedded systems startups. This article provides a set of software-development processes that work well in the context of an embedded systems startup. These include: the early stage setup of the source control and build policies, activities during start of the development stage - from the functional requirements document (FRD) to first customer ship (FCS)},

@article{20110513630446,
	Abstract = {Start-ups are crucial in the modern economy as they provide dynamism and growth. Research on the performance of new ventures increasingly investigates initial resources as determinants of success. Initial resources are said to be important because they imprint the firm at start-up, limit its strategic choices, and continue to impact its performance in the long run. The purpose of this paper is to identify configurations of initial resource bundles, strategy and environment that lead to superior performance in start-ups. To date, interdependencies between resources on the one hand and between resources, strategy and environment on the other hand have been neglected in empirical research. We rely on data mining for the analysis because it accounts for premises of configurational theory, including reversed causality, intradimensional interactions, multidimensional dependencies, and equifinality. We apply advanced data mining techniques, in the form of rule extraction from non-linear support vector machines, to induce accurate and comprehensible configurations of resource bundles, strategy and environment. We base our analysis on an extensive survey among 218 Flemish start-ups. Our experiments indicate the good performance of rule extraction technique ALBA. Finally, for comprehensibility, intuitiveness and implementation reasons, the tree is transformed into a decision table. &copy; 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Japan's Eco-Town Program spearheaded in Japan the integration of Industrial Symbiosis and Urban Symbiosis, seeking to maximise the economic and environmental benefit from close geographic proximity of industrial and urban areas, through the use of previously discarded commercial, municipal and industrial waste materials in industrial applications. The program established 26 Eco-Towns around Japan. Approximately 1.65 billion USD was invested in 61 innovative recycling projects, with an average government subsidy of 36\%. In addition at least 107 other recycling facilities have been constructed without government subsidy. 14 Eco-Towns primarily contributed to improving industry's productivity, whilst 10 Eco-Towns primarily contributed to improving environmental amenity. In 16 Eco-Towns the private sector was the most important actor supporting local government in the realisation of the Eco-Town, whilst in 9 Eco-Towns this was civil society. The availability of investment subsidies, the coming into force of ambitious recycling legislation with quantified, product-specific targets, access to the significant technological resources of the private sector, and widespread recognition of the urgency to act on environmental issues, all contributed to the success of the Eco-Town Program.},

	Abstract = {Summary Industrial symbiosis describes the mutualistic interaction of different industries for beneficial reuse of waste flows or energy cascading that results in a more resource-efficient production system and fewer adverse environmental impacts. Research shows that many information and communication technology (ICT) tools for industrial symbiosis development have been created, but the results of those efforts are unclear. Drawing from advancements in knowledge-based economics and management, this article applies a knowledge-based framework to evaluate opportunities for ICT within industrial symbiosis development. ICT systems designed to enable industrial symbiosis are surveyed and evaluated within the proposed framework to identify strengths, trends, and opportunities for continued development. An appendix provides a capsule summary of the 17 ICT tools that are assessed in the article.},

	Abstract = {A key potential contribution of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) Entrepreneurship and Investment Committee (EIC) involves facilitation of business relationships between established and startup companies. Startup ventures constitute one of the major sources of business innovation, which in turn fuels overall economic growth. Larger established companies may find it more difficult to be flexible and creative, but on the other hand they have greater depth of human and other resources, as well as credibility in the marketplace with investors, customers, suppliers, and industrial partners. Furthermore, as new companies grow, they generally encounter increasingly complex problems of management, which established companies have learned how to address effectively. Accordingly, startup and established companies clearly need each other in many cases, and it is in their interest, as well as in the interest of governments and nongovernmental organizations, to facilitate such interaction. Such efforts to encourage partnerships must include an assessment of key issues that promote-or impede-cooperation. One impeding factor is liability, which can cause established firms to shy away from working with new entrants. In case of mishaps, these larger firms might prove attractive targets for lawsuits seeking damages by aggrieved parties-even if the larger firm has had no involvement in the mishap itself. Contractual, legal, and insurance remedies exist to shield companies from inappropriate exposure to liability risks, and an international dialogue about such issues would be in the common interest. The IAF EIC could facilitate discussion of such issues, in cooperation with the IAF-affiliated International Institute of Space Law (IISL) and other legal organizations. Such an initiative could link with a similar effort already developing in the United States, led by the Commercial Space Group of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), in partnership with the Emerging Space Markets Working Group of the Space Enterprise Council. Private investor contacts facilitated by the Space Investment Summit Coalition and allied international organizations could also add a vitally important dimension, given that access to seed and early stage investment capital is essential for business startup success everywhere. Study groups within an initiative focused on the limitation of liability and damages would assemble legal and risk management experts, insurance industry representatives, business leaders, private investors, academic authorities, and government officials, in a consortium dedicated to breaking down barriers and building bridges, so that cooperation among startup and established firms could make a larger contribution to value creation and economic growth.

	Abstract = {{Start-up companies are considered an important factor in the success of
   a nation's economy. We are interested in the decisions for long-term
   survival of these firms when they have considerable cash restrictions.
   In this paper we analyse several inventory control models to manage
   inventory purchasing and return policies. The Markov decision models are
   formulated for both established companies that look at maximising
   average profit and start-up companies that look at maximising their
   long-term survival probability. We contrast both objectives, and present
   properties of the policies and the survival probabilities. We find that
   start-up companies may need to be riskier if the return price is very
   low, but there is a period where a start-up firm becomes more cautious
   than an established company and there is a point, as it accumulates
   capital, where it starts behaving as an established firm. We compare the
   various models and give conditions under which their policies are
   equivalent. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

	Abstract = {If entrepreneurs are liquidity constrained and not able to borrow to operate on an efficient scale, economic theory predicts that entrepreneurs with more personal wealth should do better than those with less wealth. We test this hypothesis using a novel data set covering a large panel of start-ups from Norway. Consistent with liquidity constraints, we find a positive relation between founder prior wealth and start-up size. The relationship between prior wealth and start-up performance, as measured by profitability on assets, increases in the first three wealth quartiles. In the top wealth quartile, however, profitability drops sharply in wealth. Our findings are consistent with a luxury good interpretation of entrepreneurship and that higher wealth may induce a less alert or a less dedicated management. We conclude that an abundance of resources might do more harm than good for start-ups.},

	Abstract = {Start-up companies are a vital ingredient in the success of a globalised networked world economy. We believe that such companies are interested in maximising the chance of surviving in the long term. We present a Markov decision model to analyse survival probabilities of start-up manufacturing companies. Our model examines the implications of their operating decisions, in particular how their inventory strategy is influenced by purchasing, shortage, transportation and ordering costs, as well as loans to the firm. It is shown that although the start-up company should be more conservative in its component purchasing strategy than if it were a well-established company it should not be too conservative. Nor is its strategy monotone in the amount of capital available},

Drawing on life course theory and human capital theory, I develop a model of how entrepreneurs' individual characteristics affect new venture decision speed.

Results show that firms made faster decisions when they were managed by older entrepreneurs and by those with prior entrepreneurial experience. In addition, exploratory analyses indicating that fast decision-making firms were more likely to close may indicate that prevailing theory in this area is contextually limited},

They use decision milestones to anticipate outcomes, risk management to prevent disasters and sequential iteration to make sure everyone is making the desired product, yet the project still ends up with an overrun schedule, overflowing budget and compromised specifications. Or it just dies. To find out why, we studied 16 projects in areas including personal-computer development, telecommunications, Internet startups, pharmaceutical development, iron-ore processing, airship development and building construction. Interviews with team members and scrutiny of project documentation over five years showed managers consistently failing to recognize that there are different types of uncertainty, each of which requires a different management approach},

	Abstract = {Why are developers, in many cases, unable to identify user problems, even when the information is ready and available? How do such miscommunication situations actually emerge and how could research and information technology help developers and users to overcome this problem? To tackle these questions, we examine a critical phase in the lifespan of a technological innovation: the transfer of a new medical technology from developers to users. Such a phase emerges especially in the early stages of implementation and diffusion, prior to the stabilization and expansion of user networks, and presupposes collaborative performance between otherwise loosely connected actors and activity systems. The innovation under scrutiny is a neuromagnetic measuring system (MEG), developed and manufactured by a Finnish start-up company. We use an activity-theoretical perspective in which the unit of analysis is a collective object-oriented activity system, a community of practitioners sharing a common object. Based on an analysis of a breakdown situation and the ensuing interactions between the users and the developers of the device, we present an enriched model of developmental contradictions in the implementation phase of the neuromagnetometer device. We argue that the anticipated outcome of the critical phase of the innovation process, the shift toward a mature customer-intelligent product driven by co-configuration work, will require a major effort to resolve developmental contradictions within and between the parties of the implementation process. As part of this re-mediation effort, shared meta-tools for dialogical diagnosis, problem solving and system redesign are needed. We suggest that these functions could conceivably be delegated to intelligent software agents, built into the MEG computer system, which would operate as boundary-crossing agents that facilitate interaction and mutual intelligibility between the perspectives of users and developers.},

	Abstract = {Open innovation has become one of the hottest topics in innovation management. This article intends to explore the limits in our understanding of the open innovation concept. In doing so, I address the questions of what (the content of open innovation), when (the context dependency) and how (the process). Open innovation is a rich concept, that can be implemented in many different ways. The context dependency of open innovation is one of the least understood topics; more research is needed on the internal and external environment characteristics affecting performance. The open innovation process relates to both the transition towards open innovation, and the various open innovation practices. As with any new concept, initial studies focus on successful and early adopters, are based on case studies, and descriptive. However, not all lessons learned from the early adopters may be applicable to following firms. Case study research increases our understanding of how things work and enables us to identify important phenomena. They should be followed by quantitative studies involving large samples to determine the relative importance of factors, to build path models to understand chains of effects, and to formally test for context dependencies. However, the evidence shows that open innovation has been a valuable concept for so many firms and in so many contexts, that it is on its way to find its final place in innovation management.},

	Abstract = {A nonlinear and non-local cochlear model has been efficiently solved in the time domain numerically, obtaining the evolution of the transverse displacement of the basilar membrane at each cochlear place. This information allows one to follow the forward and backward propagation of the traveling wave along the basilar membrane, and to evaluate the otoacoustic response from the time evolution of the stapes displacement. The phase/frequency relation of the response can be predicted, as well as the physical delay associated with the response onset time, to evaluate the relation between different cochlear characteristic times as a function of the stimulus level and of the physical parameters of the model. For a nonlinear cochlea, simplistic frequency-domain interpretations of the otoacoustic response phase behavior may give inconsistent results. Time-domain numerical solutions of the underlying nonlinear and non-local full cochlear model using a large number (thousands) of partitions in space and an adaptive mesh in time are rather time and memory consuming. Therefore, in order to be able to use standard personal computers for simulations reliably, the discretized model has been carefully designed to enforce sparsity of the matrices using a multi-iterative approach. Preliminary results concerning the cochlear characteristic delays are also presented.},

	Abstract = {To succeed financially as independent information professionals (IIPs), we need clients who recognize the value of and are willing to pay for our services. These "good" clients understand how we extend their organizational capabilities; provide actionable information, analysis and strategy; and contribute to their bottom line and the success of their mission. While small high tech businesses and start-up enterprises may appear to offer limited potential as clients due to often limited operating capital they do appreciate the value provided by IIPs. IIPs can often fill the information gap for early-stage companies that definitely need market, business and technical research, but typically have no in-house research or library staff. In fact, more than 90 percent of all businesses in the United States and Europe have fewer than 50 employees, and likely few of these small businesses have information professionals on staff. From engineering and technology scans, to business plans and grant proposals, to potential government and venture capital funding, to market and industry research to better understand their competitors, these small clients recognize they can derive real benefit from working with IIPs. In the following question and answer section, the co-authors will describe how they have built a client base consisting largely of start-up companies, entrepreneurs, tech companies, inventors and related organizations. Jan Knight, Jane John and Jocelyn Sheppard will explain their strategies for acquiring these clients, describe some of the key rewards and challenges of working with them and offer some tips for successfully meeting the needs of clients who are in pre-launch, start-up or early growth modes.},

	Abstract = {Colocated firms can achieve environmental benefit and competitive advantage from exchanging physical resources (known as industrial symbiosis) with each other or with residential areas (referenced here as urban symbiosis). Past research illustrated that economic and environmental benefits appear self-evident, although detailed quantification has only been attempted of symbioses for energy and water utilities. This article provides a complimentary case studyfor Kawasaki, Japan. The 14 documented symbioses connect steel, cement, chemical, and paperfirms and their spin-off recycling businesses. Seven key material exchanges divert annually at least 565 000 tons of waste from incineration or landfill. Four of these collectively present an estimated economic opportunity of 13.3 billion JPY (approximately 130 million USD) annually. Five symbioses involve utilization of byproduct and two sharing of utilities. The others are traditional or new recycling industries that do not specifically benefit from geographic proximity. The synergistic effect of urban and industrial symbiosis is unique. The legislative framework for a recycling-oriented society has contributed to realization of the symbioses, as has the availability of government subsidies through the Eco-Town program.},

	Abstract = {Frequently, software start-up success is explained with operational excellence of a company and pure technological right choices. However, in this research, we try to shed a light, how different amounts of completed venture capital investments could improve software start-up success. Our research results show that operational software company performance is behaving like a platform in venture capital improvement efforts, but positive performance could be improved considerably with right magnitude of financing. On the basis of our preliminary analysis, correct amount of finance will increase Net Present Value (NPV) of an investment from 17% to 74%. We also noticed that very large scale lump-sum financing in the very beginning will also yield significantly better performance. However, low operational performance will only destroy more capital, and larger investment amounts will turn into considerable disadvantage.},

Investors are impatient to see product, existing competitors have momentum and presence that must be countered, the processes and quality metrics are being defined along with, if not behind, product specification and development, and the development organization can often double within one or two weeks. Processes cannot assume a status quo, or even a predictably changing environment. This talk will present lessons from the trenches: process definition, knowledge capture, product delivery, educating QA, company structure, and some interesting possibly hereticalobservations.},

	Abstract = {Start-up companies and young firms are driving forces of innovation and regional economic development. They are acknowledged to play a crucial role as innovation agents, particularly, in knowledge-based industries. Most scholars agree that young firms and academic spin-offs innovate more radically, drawing on the knowledge generated in universities and research organisations. It is often assumed that they are strongly embedded in the local innovative milieu, benefiting from local knowledge providers and innovation interactions. In this paper we investigate to what extent start-up companies in the Vienna Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector differ from more established firms in their innovation activities and types of knowledge interactions. The research results presented are based on an analysis of data from a firm survey covering ICT firms located in Vienna.},

	Abstract = {The Korea National Cleaner Production Center (KNCPC) affiliated to the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH) has started a 15 year, 3-phase EIP master plan with the support of Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy (MOCIE). A total of 6 industrial parks, including industrial parks in Ulsan city, known as the industrial capital of South Korea, are planning projects to find the feasibility of shifting existing industrial parks to eco-industrial parks. The basic survey shows that Ulsan industrial complex has been continuously evolving from conventional industrial complexes to eco-industrial parks by spontaneous industrial symbiosis. This paper describes the Korean national policies and the developmental activities of this vision to drive the global trend of innovation for converting the existing industrial parks to eco-industrial parks through inter-industry waste, energy, and material exchange in Ulsan Industrial complexes.

In this chapter, the authors illustrate the variety of designs and applications using several prominent examples of organizational surveys. Next, they examine the sequence of decisions that organizational surveys confront regarding study design, sampling frames and methods, identifying key informants, questionnaire construction, gaining access to organizations, data collection and dataset management. The authors conclude that the survey research methods covered by this chapter are especially valuable for organizational studies when representativeness and generalization are central study objectives. They expect that future organizational surveys will give increased attention to dynamic questions about trends in organizational practices and organizational change. They hope to see the strengths of surveys combined with complementary approaches, especially case studies, in multi-method research designs. These and other design variations, together with innovations in modes and methods of data collection, will sustain the vitality of survey data for research on organizations and organizational behavior.},

@article{Kaplan1992,
	Abstract = {Frustrated by the inadequacies of traditional performance measurement systems, some managers have abandoned financial measures like return on equity and earnings per share. "Make operational improvements and the numbers will follow," the argument goes. But managers do not want to choose between financial and operational measures. Executives want a balanced presentation of measures that allow them to view the company from several perspectives simultaneously. During a year-long research project with 12 companies at the leading edge of performance measurement, the authors developed a "balanced scorecard," a new performance measurement system that gives top managers a fast but comprehensive view of the business. The balanced scorecard includes financial measures that tell the results of actions already taken. And it complements those financial measures with three sets of operational measures having to do with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's ability to learn and improve-the activities that drive future financial performance. Managers can create a balanced scorecard by translating their company's strategy and mission statements into specific goals and measures. To create the part of the scorecard that focuses on the customer perspective, for example, executives at Electronic Circuits Inc. established general goals for customer performance: get standard products to market sooner, improve customers' time-to-market, become customers' supplier of choice through partnerships, and develop innovative products tailored to customer needs. Managers translated these elements of strategy into four specific goals and identified a measure for each.},

The structure and roles of the companies active in the industry are far from settled and the entrepreneurial activity in the area is very strong. For new ventures in emerging industries rapid learning is key. Opportunistic adaptation and strategy formation is likely to be characterized by frequent changes in the business model. These efforts at strategic experimentation are reflective of the trial-and-error learning process associated with trying to establish a viable competitive position. This paper presents an identification and analysis of 139 unlisted Nordic start-up companies related to Wireless Internet. Primary geographical focus of the study has been the Swedish market but companies in other Nordic countries have been included. Personal interviews have been conducted with 67 of the companies},

	Abstract = {The entrepreneurial process of new business creation starts when a business opportunity is discovered or created by nascent entrepreneurs. This process involves a journey of improvising and coping with uncertainty. There are many obstacles as well as pulling, pushing, and driving forces that the entrepreneur may encounter along the way. In this paper, There need the internal driving forces that solves these problems by taking entrepreneurial actions to actualize new business potential against all odds. The series of entrepreneurs' autonomous, innovative, and improvised actions throughout the entrepreneurial process will consist the entrepreneurial journey. This journey will be viewed as a combination of volitional and emergent process of transforming potentiality into actuality, that is, opportunity realization. This paper attempts to explain the internal driving forces that direct, drive, and sustain entrepreneurial processes with and against internal and external conditions and changes. An entrepreneurial process is composed of driving forces of activity and a number of activities related with resource and opportunity. In this paper, we conceptualize the obsessive motivation and internal driving forces that catalyzes the entrepreneurial journey as entrepreneurial intent: entrepreneurial mindset that can be defined as an aroused state of entrepreneurial motivation to initiate, drive and sustain the entrepreneurial journey til the opportunity is completely transformed to real business. A case study method that implements a modified version of the grounded theory method is applied to identify the multidimensional and emergent processes of this entrepreneurial journey. This study examines a sample of high-tech venture firms in Korea. The results show that entrepreneurial intent toward a new opportunity emerges as collective actions for combining new resources to create new value. In the journey, entrepreneurial intent can be considered as internal driving force because it is at the center of underlying layers of the emergent process of opportunity realization. In successful journeys, entrepreneurial intent seems to be an extreme level of entrepreneurial motivation because it is characterized by more energetic functions of motivation: arousal, direction, and duration of entrepreneurial activity. In this paper, these three functions will be referred to as the 3C Effects: the channeling (arousal), the concentrating (direction), and the continuing (duration) of entrepreneurial action. This mechanism converts the actions of the entrepreneur and his/her firm into entrepreneurial ones that aim to seize every chance to make the opportunity into reality. The entrepreneurial actions, increase the chances of serendipity in the external process of creating, attracting, and combining resources to meet the value criteria of market opportunity. Cases of entrepreneurial journey are analyzed in layered and diamond type frameworks. In summary, the volitional and emergent journey can be illuminated by frameworks consisting of multiple phases, dimensions and layers of entrepreneurial process that interact with various kinds of external conditions including business opportunities. &copy; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {{Most startup companies today consider overseas expansion from their
   inception. Yet, says the author, entrepreneurs and their managers often
   underestimate the cost of expansion and lack a clear conceptual
   framework for it.
   On the basis of studying 50 entrepreneurial ventures in more than 20
   countries, he concludes that such ventures follow a variety of different
   expansion paths. The most successful are those that best manage the
   constant tensions between resources and opportunities, each of which run
   the gamut from purely local to worldwide. He offers a framework that
   defines the choices a venture has at its inception and throughout its
   life, then shows how the framework can be used to assess and direct a
   venture and mitigate developing tensions by anticipating a variety of
   strategic, financial, organizational and regulatory factors. This is
   illustrated with case examples of a software company that took a
   balanced or ``diagonal{''} path (the most common), an air-freight
   delivery service that progressed from pursuing local opportunities with
   local resources to pursuing cross-border opportunities with local
   resources, and a consumer-loan provider that began by pursuing a local
   opportunity with local resources, then added crossborder resources.
   Other examples include London-based fashion e-tailer Boo.com,
   Boston-based Internet Securities Inc. and the Georgian Glass and Mineral
   Water Co. in the Republic of Georgia.}},

@article{Wasserman2008,
	Abstract = {Why do people start businesses? For the money and the chance to control their own companies, certainly. But new research from Harvard Business School professor Wasserman shows that those goals are largely incompatible. The author's studies indicate that a founder who gives up more equity to attract cofounders, new hires, and investors builds a more valuable company than one who parts with less equity. More often than not, however, those superior returns come from replacing the founder with a professional CEO more experienced with the needs of a growing company. This fundamental tension requires founders to make "rich" versus "king" trade-offs to maximize either their wealth or their control over the company. Founders seeking to remain in control (as John Gabbert of the furniture retailer Room \& Board has done) would do well to restrict themselves to businesses where large amounts of capital aren't required and where they already have the skills and contacts they need. They may also want to wait until late in their careers, after they have developed broader management skills, before setting up shop. Entrepreneurs who focus on wealth, such as Jim Triandiflou, who founded Ockham Technologies, can make the leap sooner because they won't mind taking money from investors or depending on executives to manage their ventures. Such founders will often bring in new CEOs themselves and be more likely to work with their boards to develop new, post-succession roles for themselves. Choosing between money and power allows entrepreneurs to come to grips with what success means to them. Founders who want to manage empires will not believe they are successes if they lose control, even if they end up rich. Conversely, founders who understand that their goal is to amass wealth will not view themselves as failures when they step down from the top job.},

@book{Christensen1997,
	Abstract = {What do the Honda Supercub, Intel's 8088 processor, and hydraulic excavators have in common? They are all examples of disruptive technologies that helped to redefine the competitive landscape of their respective markets. These products did not come about as the result of successful companies carrying out sound business practices in established markets. In The Innovator's Dilemma, author Clayton M. Christensen shows how these and other products cut into the low end of the marketplace and eventually evolved to displace high-end competitors and their reigning technologies. At the heart of The Innovator's Dilemma is how a successful company with established products keeps from being pushed aside by newer, cheaper products that will, over time, get better and become a serious threat. Christensen writes that even the best-managed companies, in spite of their attention to customers and continual investment in new technology, are susceptible to failure no matter what the industry, be it hard drives or consumer retailing. Succinct and clearly written, The Innovator's Dilemma is an important book that belongs on every manager's bookshelf. Highly recommended. -Harry C. Edwards In this revolutionary bestseller, Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership, or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.Focusing on "disruptive technology" of the Honda Supercub, Intel's 8088 processor, and the hydraulic excavator, Christensen shows why most companies miss "the next great wave." Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator's Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation. Revised, updated, and with a new chapter, this book continues to take the radical position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right. It demonstrates why outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology-and it explains how to avoid a similar fate. Drawing on insights from a number of industries-such as the computer and disk drive industries, discount retailing, minimills, pharmaceuticals, and the automobile industry-Christensen shows why good management often turns out to be all wrong-and what to do about it.},

	Abstract = {Startup software companies have assumed that bringing a product to market first and then investing more than their competitors in sales, marketing and product development was the road map to a winning outcome. However, a new study charting the common characteristics of both successful and unsuccessful software companies claims that, on average, winners are not first to market and do not spend more on sales and marketing or product development. Rather, successful companies become large, profitable businesses for a variety of unexpected reasons. The authors extrapolate that these firms understood that maintaining higher prices tests a product's potential for success, inducing marketers to articulate a compelling customer value proposition. Sales-force productivity is an excellent predictor of long-term software success},

	Abstract = {- grounded theory is a method of analysis for ANY data - observation, survey, or case study. It is NOT a qualitative-only method - a code is the link between data and theory - break the data into pieces, and then group it again by codes NB code = concept OPEN CODING - open coding is the beginning, trying to represent the data; ask it questions - what is this data about? - what category does this incident suggest? - what is actually happening here? What accounts for this? - every sentence should be coded - every idea should be memoed SELECTIVE CODING - with codes established, choose a core variable/process, the one this paper will be about (all others are in supporting roles) - it should account for most of the variation in behavior - what is most important to people dealing with the issue? - must be common, linked to most other codes, have clear implications beyond the setting, it is a dependent variable (i.e., conditions cause it to vary) - may be a process, a consequence, a condition, a dimension, etc. - if it is a process, it will have an "ing" ending (e.g., normalizing, becoming, centering, defaulting) - look for it and things supporting it - look at only those things directly related to the core variable or process - gaps in these memos indicate where theoretical samples should be drawn - typologies are useful - informants' concepts of types will imply dimensions of differentiation - having dimensions will lead to labelling of types, when juxtaposed - best to focus on behavior types, not types of people (too simplifying) THEORETICAL CODING - hypotheses about the relationships among codes - he has 'families' of codes; these are ways of conceptualizing or organizing these aren't all of his, and some are mine (1) Six Cs: causes, contexts, contingencies, consequences, covariances and conditions (2) Process - stages, phases, progressions, trajectories, etc. (3) Degree - limit, extent, amount, polarity, etc. (continuous range of the phenomenon) (4) Dimensions - elements, portions, sectors (finite level categories) (5) Types - style, class, genre, variations (6) Strategy - mechanisms, tactics, ways (be careful to impute intention that cannot be supported) (7) Interaction - focus on the covariation of two variables when they can't be ordered causally or temporally (8) Identity - self concept, image (aspects/dimensions/content need to be clearly specified, because these are loaded terms) (9) Tipping point - key level, tolerance, boundary, threshold (10) Means-ends - goals, purpose, product, consequence (11) Culture - norms, values, beliefs (12) Consensus - agreement, aggregation, contract, conflict, disagreement, politics, heterogeneity (13) Control - socialization, order, conformity, power, tradition, hierarchy (14) Ordering/ranking of some sort - temporal, structural, size, level, generality (15) Units - collective, group, belonging, family (16) Roles - routines, habits, duties, classes (17) Systems - system dynamics endogenous cause \&amp; flow MEMO first, last, and always. interrupt everything to write about every idea. "If the analyst skips this stage by going directly from coding to sorting or to writing he is not doing grounded theory." (p. 83) - memos capture ideas in a sortable format (i.e., titled, key concepts highlighted) - memoing slows the pace, forcing one to fully think through assumptions/conclusions - make sure memos are kept distinct from data - a given incident should only be used to illustrate one concept SORTING - this is the actual integration of the theory, putting the pieces back together - sort the memos, and only one way, for a particular paper (the same memos can be sorted differently in the future for a different paper) - generate an integrated outline - ALL the codes that relate to the core have to appear somewhere, and ONLY the parts related to the core should appear - keep asking where does this fit in? - useful to draw a linear ordering of the theory - sort for sections of the paper, and then within the sections - determine where an idea will be elaborated, and where it will only be ar ied forward from previous definition theoretical completeness = explaining the most variation with the minimum of concepts WRITING - intro = general problem, method, outline of findings - set up the problem with grounded detail, draw in literature as a supplement, not as the motivating force - paper usually only deals with one property of the core concept in the theory - start with the core concept, then 'funnel down' to the one property to be discussed; this makes the narrow focus of the paper part of a larger issue, more broadly relevant - then sketch how the promise of the paper will be fulfilled, and how the parts relate to each other - end with general conclusions, NOT a summary - talk about practical implications - talk about links to other theories, and potential for a broader, formal theory of the phenomenon - write about concepts, not people (about cultivating clients, not milkmen recruiting housewives) - detailed illustration shows an example, but does not stand in as proof; the credibility of the theory depends upon its integration - 'actually do theory, instead of telling the reader you will do it' - be careful of analogies; they will only be partially right, and distract from the actual nature of the concept - get the first draft written in a rush, don't worry about grammar or even connections - and NO literature - during the design, collection, analysis, and first draft read OTHER things, never the literature of the field - when the first draft is down, start reading in the field, to find where the links are - use literature/cites to indicate where the theory fits in, but no more than that, and no more than necessary},

@article{Eisenhardt1998,
	Abstract = {Most companies change in reaction to events such as moves by the competition, shifts in technology, or new customer demands. In fairly stable markets, "event pacing" is an effective way to deal with change. But successful companies in rapidly changing, intensely competitive industries take a different approach. They change proactively, through regular deadlines. The authors call this strategy time pacing. Like a metronome, time pacing creates a rhythm to which managers can synchronize the speed and intensity of their efforts. For example, 3M dictates that 25\% of its revenues every year will come from new products, Netscape introduces a new product about every six months, and Intel adds a new fabrication facility to its operations approximately every nine months. Time pacing creates a relentless sense of urgency around meeting deadlines and concentrates people on a common set of goals. Its predictability also provides people with a sense of control in otherwise chaotic markets. The authors show how companies such as Banc One, Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, Emerson Electric, Gillette, Intel, Netscape, Shiseido, and Sony implement the two essentials of time pacing. The first is managing transitions-the shift, for example, from one new-product-development project to the next. The second is setting the right rhythm for change. Companies that march to the rhythm of time pacing build momentum, and companies that effectively manage transitions sustain that momentum without missing important beats.},

Increasing maturity results in the need to adjust the innovation style of a company. This paper has the objective to explore the dynamics behind innovations, what capabilities are needed at which stage of companies life cycle, and the challenges to innovate in transformation. Over 200 high-technology companies have been examined to observe the transformation from a start-up phase to a more mature phase of business. Results indicate the importance of market orientation, knowledge, management capabilities, social networks to innovation, success and sustainability. The study reveals that major changes are required in knowledge enhancement and acquisition, the use of formal social networks and the establishment and use of performance networks to allow a successful transition to a sustainable mature company.},

	Abstract = {Global software development has become an extremely important issue for organizations at present in the climate of increasing tendency towards globalization and global outsourcing. A number of studies have been conducted which have identified a set of problematic-areas which are common across projects, including language and cultural differences, trust factors, communication across temporal and spatial distances, lack of shared contextual awareness. This study of global software development at Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) is especially noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, the project has recently moved from a co-located to a globally-distributed one, and thus the team had already had experience of being co-located a factor that has not typically been the case in the studies published to date where teams are being established who have not previously been co-located. Also, as language and cultural factors were not an issue, the study was able to focus on the problems of communication over temporal and spatial distances. The study discusses how ADI attempted to address these problems and identifies the initiatives that worked well, and, more importantly, those that did not work as well. Among the findings was the fact that trust, which had been very solidly established among team members during co-location, was significantly eroded as the project team was reconstituted on a distributed basis},
